    Dear <%= name %>,

    Thanks for booking a party. Here is confirmation of your details:

    <%= summary %>

    Don't worry if there are small changes between now and your party date as we will check you in on arrival and alterations can be discussed at that point.
    Please note, you will be charged for just the children you bring on the day but this is subject to minimum booking numbers - see Charging Policy, below.
    
    Please feel free to give us a call or email info@bigplaybarn.com if you have any questions, specific requests, or wish to make any significant changes (e.g. date or time).
       
    Charging Policy:
    All bookings have a minimum charge of 12 paying children.
    All children that enter the farm or barn as a guest of your party must pay the party price, regardless of how long they stay or whether they are eating.
    The siblings of your guests may not enter for free. They must join your party as an extra chargeable guest, or, if they are not joining the meal, pay independently for entry as a normal day-visitor (see website for rates).

    We look forward to seeing you on the big day,

    The Big Play Barn and Children's Farm team
